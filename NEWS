                 CHANGES IN EvalEst VERSION 2009.9-1

  o The dse bundle has been unbundled and the packages dse1 and dse2 renamed to
    dse and EvalEst respectively.  Some additional reorganization has been done 
    to give a slightly different focus to the second package. Stub packages dse1
    and dse2 have been created to facilitate conversion for users' existing 
    code. These stub packages simply require dse and EvalEst respectively.
    
  o Older NEWS on dse2 is in the dse NEWS file.
